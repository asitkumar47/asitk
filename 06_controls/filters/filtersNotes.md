# Introduction
Filters play a significant role in signal processing, noise reduction, and state estimation. A filter takes in an input $x(t)$ and produces a desired output $y(t)$ often with attenuating undesired components like noise, certain frequencies, etc... Filters can be classified as
- linear vs. nonlinear
- time-invariant vs. time-variant
- causal vs. non-causal
- analog vs. digital

# LTI filters
Linear time-invariant filters can be represented as transfer functions, impulse response, or state space format. The most common representation is a transfer function.
Common types of LTI filters are
- low pass
- high pass
- band (notch) pass

# Metrics to evaluate a filter
1. magnitude response
2. phase response
3. delay
4. roll-off rate (filter order)
5. transition width
6. stopband attenuation
7. passband ripple
8. stopband ripple
9. pole-zero stability
