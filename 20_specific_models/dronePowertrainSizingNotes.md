# Hover power
## List of methods (non-CFD)
1. Momentum theory
2. Blade element theory

## Momentum theory
- *Momentum* refers to the linear momentum of the airflow that is accelerated as the rotor (propeller) spins
- The theory is based on momentum conservation, which translates to the increase in momentum corresponding to equal and opposite reaction force (thrust) generated by the propeller
- Assumptions
	- propeller is an actuator disk
	- flow is incompressible
	- air is accelerated from still air to fully developed wake
		- $v_{wake} = v_{induced}$

### Equation

# Cruise power

## List of methods (non-CFD)
1. Lift-to-drag ($L/D$) ratio based
2. Drag based

## $L/D$ method
1. Every aircraft will have a $L/D$ curve
2. It is parabolic in nature with a minimum at the best cruise speed
3. Obviously, lift = weight at cruise (fully airborne $\rightarrow$ weight fully supported by the wings)

#### Equation
$$
P_{cruise} = \frac{W}{L/D}\ v_{cruise} \times \frac{1}{\eta_{cruise}}
$$

$L/D$ (just drag, as lift is constant in wing-borne flight) has a parabolic dependence on cruise speed

# Battery sizing
## Power sizing
**Additional parameters / models necessary**
1. $\eta_{powertrain}$ powertrain efficiency
$$
P_{maxBattery} = \frac{1}{\eta_{powertrain}} \times max(P_{hover},\ P_{cruise})
$$
* Most likely $P_{hover}>>P_{cruise}$ around *best range* speed
* There will be slight difference (a percent or two) in $\eta_{powertrain}$ during hover and cruise 
## Energy sizing
**Additional Parameters / models / requirements necessary**
1. $\eta_{powertrain}$ powertrain efficiency
2. $d$ total range requirement 
3. $t_{hover}$ hover time 
4. $v_{cruise}$ cruise speed 
$$
E_{total} = (t_{hover} \times P_{hover} + \frac{d}{v_{cruise}} \times P_{cruise}) \times \frac{1}{\eta_{powertrain}} \times \frac{1}{1000\times3600}\ \  kWh
$$

## Cell architecture
- number of cells in series is a simple
$$
n_s = \frac {V_{bat_{min}}} {V_{cell_{min}}}
$$
$V_{bat_{min}}$ is a requirement, $V_{cell_{min}}$ is cell specification
- number of cells is parallel (#parallel branches of series cell) needs two main consideration
	- energy required for the mission
	- maximum discharge C-rate of the cell
- if the cell chemistry doesn't allow, we might need to add parallel branches just to be below the maximum allowable discharge C-rates and end up with higher than required energy ^f66303


## Choice of cell chemistry
Comparison is limited to Li-Polymer and Li-ion
- Li-Po is more popular for drones
- Li-Po has more than twice the power density $W/kg$ (higher C-rates) and about 25% less energy density  $Wh/kg$
- Depending on the ratio of battery-to-drone mass the 25% might look even less
- But if the range requirements are *really* high, Li-ion batteries might be a better option as [[dronePowertrainSizingNotes#^f66303|this reasoning]] would no longer be valid
- For *heavy* lifting Li-Po are a better option 
- Other relevant differences - Li-Po $\rightarrow$
	- life span is lower by about 50% (300 cycles)
	- safety 
		- more prone to swelling (flexible casing)
		- less prone to thermal runaway
	- higher lowest operating voltage (part of reason why less energy dense)
	- comes mostly in pouch configuration (as opposed to cylindrical Li-ion), but pouch cells might need structural reinforcements that might take away the volumetric density advantage of Li-Po (pouch cell) when it comes to making a battery with multiple cells
		- note that when making a battery, the volumetric density drops for both types of cells (wasted space for cylindrical), (structural reinforcements for punch), but the mass density will also decrease for pouch cells

# Motor sizing
## Rating
### Power rating
This is same as battery power rating excluding $1/\eta_{powertrain}$
$$
P_{maxMotor} = max(P_{hover},\ P_{cruise})
$$
### Torque rating ($\tau$)
**Data needed $\rightarrow$ Thrust vs. prop speed curve**
Generally we have an upper limit on the radius of the propeller
And we have the maximum thrust required as about 1.3 x weight of the drone (extra 30% for controllability)
$$
T_{max_{prop}} = \frac{W + 0.3W}{n_{prop}}
$$
Propeller speed required for $T_{max}$ can be found by
$$
\omega_{maxProp}\ (rad/s) = \frac{1}{R} \times \sqrt \frac{T_{max_{prop}}}{0.5C_T\rho (\pi R^2)}
$$

|Symbol           | Description|                Unit|
|--------------|------------------|--------------------|
| $T_{max}$     | maximum required thrust (per prop)| $N$|
| $R$|radius of the prop|$m$|
| $C_T$|thrust coefficient (0.1 - 0.2)|-|
| $\rho$|air density|$kg/m^3$|

Motor's torque rating can be found from Power rating and Speed rating (max) as
$$
\tau_{max} = \frac{P_maxMotor}{\omega_{maxProp}}
$$

Note: $C_T$ for a *particular* (fixed diameter, number of blades) propeller will vary wrt:
- advance ratio (forward speed / propeller speed)
- blade pitch
- angle of attack (of the drone)
- *low* propeller speeds where Reynold's number changes are significant

## Thermals

### Heat generation
$$
Q_{gen} = Q_{stator} + Q_{mech}
$$
$$
= (Q_{copper} + Q_{iron}) + (Q_{friction} + Q_{windage})   
$$
$$
= (Q_{winding} + Q_{hysteresis} + Q_{eddycurrent}) + (Q_{friction} + Q_{windage})
$$

$Q_{rotor}$ is minimal 

### Heat loss
$$Q_{cool} = Q_{cond} + Q_{conv} + Q_{rad}$$
- $Q_{cond} \rightarrow$ motor to motor housing (Fourier's law)
	- 
- $Q_{conv} \rightarrow$ airflow (forced conv.) over motor housing (Newton's law of cooling)
- $Q_{rad} \rightarrow$ (Stefan-Boltzmann's law)

For small/mid-sized air-cooled drones $\rightarrow$ forced convection is the main heat transfer means

### Steady state analysis
This gives $a$ steady state temperature for a given set of operating conditions (torque, speed, voltage, air flow, ambient temperature)

### Dynamic model
#### Assumptions
Lumped capacitance can be used for the motor housing becuase  Biot number $B_i = hL_c/k << 0.1$
	$h$ convective HT coefficient
	$k$ thermal conductivity (of motor housing)
	$L_c$ characteristic length (volume / cooled surface area)
	$L_c = L/2$ for a fat short cylinder ($R>>L$)

#### Equations
$$
mc_p\dot T = hA(T_{a} - T)
$$
$T$ is temperature of cylinder surface
$T_{a}$ is air temperature

$$
h = \frac{N_u k}{D}
$$
$k$ is thermal conductivity of air $0.026 W.m^{-1}K^{-1}$ @room temperature
$D$ is outer diameter of the cylinder $m$

$$
N_u = C R_e^mP_r^n
$$
$C, m, n = 0.023, 0.8, 0.33$ for turbulent flow
$P_r$ is Prantl number $= 0.7$ for air

$$
R_e = \frac{\rho V_{air} L_c}{\mu}
$$
$V_{air}$ is air velocity $m/s$
$L_c$ is characteristic length of the cylinder $m$
$\mu$ is dynamic viscosity of air $Pa.s$

Note $L_c$ depends on flow configuration and smoothness of the flow surface
- for cross-flow on short-fat smooth cylinder (drone motor) $L_c = 2r_{cylinder}$
- for cross-flow on short-fat finned cylinder $L_c = D_{hydraulic}$
$$
D_{hydraulic} = \frac{4A_{flow}}{P_{wet}}
$$
$A_{flow}$ is cross-sectional area of flow $m^2$
$P_{wet}$ is wetter perimeter $m$


### Addition of fins
1. It increases effective surface area $A_{eff} = A + n_{fin}A_{fin}$
2. It might increase $h$ too if the fins induce more turbulence

Although cooling might not increase proportionally with increase in area due to fins. It depends on fin efficiency. Heat transfer equation might become
$$
mc_p\dot T = hA_{eff}\eta_{fin}(T_{a} - T)
$$




### Natural vs. forced convection [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHMsb13jRQw)
- Natural convection is the fluid motion driven by the density difference occurring due to temperature gradients
- Forced convection is the fluid motion driven by an external force (fan, pump, wind)
- Both are modeled by Newton's law of cooling
	- $Q_{conv} = hA(T_{surface}. - T_{ambient})$
- **The key difference is how the heat transfer coefficient $h$ is determined**
	- calculation of heat transfer coefficient $h$ is same for for both cases
	$$h = \frac{N_u k}{L}$$
	- but calculation of $N_u$ varies

		- For natural convection
$$
N_u = C(G_rP_r)^n
$$
		- For forced convection
$$
N_u = CR_e^mP_r^n
$$

$k$ is thermal conductivity of the fluid ($W.m^-1K^-1$)
$P_r$ is Prantl number
$G_r$ is Grasshof number
$C, m, n$ are constants
For more details look at [[basicThermals#Dimensionless numbers]]



||Nat. conv.|Forced conv.|
|-|-|-|
|Key dimensionless number|Grashof's number $Gr$|Reynolds number $Re$|
||||
|Driving force|Buoyancy ($\Delta \rho$)|External force|
|Cooling $\eta$|Low|High|

#### Things to know
- heat transfer is better in turbulent flow
	- better fluid mixing increasing the convective heat transfer $h$
	- mathematically $R_e$ is bigger for turbulent flow
		- but note - $N_u$ dependence of $R_e$ also varies from laminar to turbulent flow


### Cooling efficiency

## Aside on prop sizing
By propeller sizing $\rightarrow$ 
find the 
1. propeller radius
2. number of blades
3. possibly pitch of the blades too

such that
1. thrust > $T_{max_{prop}}$
2. radius < geometrical constraints
3. noise < requirements

Thrust
$$
T \propto \omega^2R^4
$$

This allows lower prop speed for the same thrust requirement, e.g., 10% increase in radius will reduce speed requirement by ~ 18%. This effect *may* be even more pronounced as coefficient of thrust also increases with propeller radius.

Torque is supposed to increase with $R^3$ (to be researched)
