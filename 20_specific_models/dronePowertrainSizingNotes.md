# Power requirements
## Hover power
### List of methods (non-CFD)
1. Momentum theory
2. Blade element theory

### Momentum theory
- *Momentum* refers to the linear momentum of the airflow that is accelerated as the rotor (propeller) spins
- The theory based on momentum conservation, which translates to the increase in momentum corresponds to equal and opposite reaction force (thrust) generated by the propeller
- Assumptions
	- propeller is an actuator disk
	- flow is incompressible
	- air is accelerated from still air to fully developed wake
		- $v_{wake} = v_{induced}$

#### Equation
$$
P_{hover} = \frac{W^{3/2}}{\sqrt{2 \rho (n_{prop}A)}} \times \frac{1}{\eta_{hover}}
$$

#### Derivation


## Cruise power

### List of methods (non-CFD)
1. Lift-to-drag ($L/D$) ratio based
2. Drag based

### $L/D$ method
1. Every aircraft will have a $L/D$ curve
2. It is parabolic in nature with a minimum at the best cruise speed
3. Obviously, lift = weight at cruise (fully airborne $\rightarrow$ weight fully supported by the wings)

#### Equation
$$
P_{cruise} = \frac{W}{L/D}\ v_{cruise} \times \frac{1}{\eta_{cruise}}
$$
