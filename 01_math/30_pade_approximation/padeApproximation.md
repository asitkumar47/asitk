# Pade approximation (PA)
## General description
* At it's core the PA is a fucntion approximation.   
* Any fucntion can be approximated as a rational (ratio of) polynominal function. 
	* The numerator and denominator can be of different order.  
* In the dynamical-systems world, it is commonly used to approximate a time delay.
* A linear ODE can be represented as a Transfer Function.  

### Why time delay in a system matters
* Short answer - [stability margins]()
* Systems with delays mathematically have $\infty$ poles. So controllers like LQR can not be used.

## Asides
