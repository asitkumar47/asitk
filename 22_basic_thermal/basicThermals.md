## Reynold's number
Difference between laminar and turbulent flow
$$
R_e = \frac{\rho V L_c}{\mu}
$$
$V$ is air velocity $m/s$
$L_c$ characteristic length $m$
$\mu$ is dynamic viscosity of fluid $Pa.s$
$\rho$ density of fluid

$L_c$ depends on the flow configuration
- for pipe flow $L_c = r_{pipe}$
- for cross-flow over a cylinder (flow perpendicular to axis) $L_c = 2r_{cylinder})$

## Prantl number

## Grashof's number

## Nusselt number
Ratio of convection and conduction heat transfer

## Biot number $B_i$
- Biot number is the ratio of thermal resistance for conduction inside a body to the resistance for convection at the surface of the body.
- Problems involving small Biot number ($<<1$) are analytically simpler.
	- this makes temperature uniform inside the body
	- enabling lumped capacitance modeling for body temperature evolution
$$
B_i = \frac{h}{k}L_c
$$
$$
L_c = \frac{Body\ volume}{Heated/ cooled\ surface\ area}
$$

$h$ is convective heat transfer $W.m^{-2}K{-1}$
$k$ is thermal conductivity $W.m^{-1}K^{-1}$
$L_c$ is characteristic length $m$
